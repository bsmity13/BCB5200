This website houses all the materials for BCB 4200/5200 at the University of Idaho for Spring 2026. Current students please note that we are still using [Canvas](https://canvas.uidaho.edu) for submitting assignments and grading.

This course material was adapted and developed by [Brian J. Smith](https://github.com/bsmity13). The course was originally designed and taught by [Barrie Robison](https://professorpolymorphic.github.io/RobisonWebSite), and his version of the material is a valuable resource, available here: [https://professorpolymorphic.github.io/BCB520/](https://professorpolymorphic.github.io/BCB520/)

On this website, you will find an [abbreviated syllabus](syllabus.qmd), [lectures](lectures.qmd), [code walkthroughs](code.qmd), and [assignments](assignments.qmd).
