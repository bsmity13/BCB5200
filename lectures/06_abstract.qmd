## Data Abstraction

</br>

The goal of this chapter is to understand *what* can be visualized.  

</br>

Figure 2.1 (next slide) summarizes the topic.

# Semantics and Types

## Why do data semantics and types matter? {.smaller}

- **Semantics** of the data is its real-world meaning.
- **Type** of the data is its structural or mathematical interpretation.
  - For example, numbers might represent a count of items. In this case, it makes sense to add them together to get a total count.
  - Alternatively, a number might represent a postal code. In this case, it is really a name for a *category* that happens to be represented with numbers rather than alphabetical characters. It doesn't make any sense to add them together.

## Semantics and Types

</br>

Imagine the following data:

`Basil, 7, S, Pear`

What do these data mean?

## Semantics and Types

`Basil, 7, S, Pear`

::: {.incremental}

- Maybe a food shipment of produce arrived in satsifactory condition on the 7th day of the month, containing basil and pears?
- Maybe the Basil Point neighborhood had 7 inches of snow cleared by the Pear Creek Limited snow removal service?
- Maybe the lab rat named Basil has made 7 attempts to navigate the south section of the maze and was given a pear as a reward?

## Semantics and Types

</br> 

Sometimes, types and semantics can be correctly inferred from the syntax of a data file or from names of variables.

</br> 

Often, this additional information must be provided along with the dataset in an additional format. This additional information is called **metadata**.

# Data Types

## Data Types

- Earlier, Munzner used the terminology **type** to refer to the structural interpretation of the data.
- Now, she uses **data type** to mean something different.
- The 5 basic **data types** discussed in this book are:

![The 5 data types: items, attributes, links, positions, and grids](fig/fig2_1a.png)\

## Data Types

![The 5 data types: items, attributes, links, positions, and grids](fig/fig2_1a.png)\

</br>

An **item** is a discrete individual entity, such as a row in a table or a node in a network.

## Data Types

![The 5 data types: items, attributes, links, positions, and grids](fig/fig2_1a.png)\

</br>

An **attribute** is some specific property that can be measured, observed, or logged.

## Data Types

![The 5 data types: items, attributes, links, positions, and grids](fig/fig2_1a.png)\

</br>

A **link** is a relationship between items, typically within a network.

## Data Types

![The 5 data types: items, attributes, links, positions, and grids](fig/fig2_1a.png)\

</br>

A **position** is spatial data in 2D or 3D space.

## Data Types

![The 5 data types: items, attributes, links, positions, and grids](fig/fig2_1a.png)\

</br>

A **grid** is a sampling of continuous data in terms of both geometric and topological relationships between its cells.

# Dataset Types

## Dataset Types {.smaller}

- A **dataset** is any collection of information that is the target of analysis.
- The 4 basic **dataset types** discussed in this book are:

![The 4 dataset types: tables, networks, fields, geometry](fig/fig2_1b.png)\

(Apparently, clusters, sets, and lists are other groupings of items).


## Dataset Types {.smaller}

![The 4 dataset types: tables, networks, fields, geometry](fig/fig2_1b.png)\  

- **Tables** are the familiar arrangement of rows and columns, like a spreadsheet.
- For a simple **flat table**:
  - Each row represents an **item**.
  - Each column is an **attribute** of that item.
  - Each **cell** is fully specified by row and column and contains a **value**.
  
## Dataset Types {.smaller}

![The 4 dataset types: tables, networks, fields, geometry](fig/fig2_1b.png)\  

- A **multidimensional table** has a more complex structure for indexing into a cell, with multiple **keys**.
- A **key** serves as an index to lookup values.

## Dataset Types {.smaller}

![The 4 dataset types: tables, networks, fields, geometry](fig/fig2_1b.png)\  

- A **network** is used to specify relationships between two or more items.
- An **item** in a network is referred to as a **node**.
  - **Nodes** can have associated **attributes**.
- A **link** is a relation between two items.
  - **Links** can also have associated **attributes**.
  
## Dataset Types {.smaller}

![The 4 dataset types: tables, networks, fields, geometry](fig/fig2_1b.png)\  

- A **network** with hierarchical structure is called a **tree**.
- **Trees** cannot have cycles; each child node has only one parent node pointing to it.

## Dataset Types {.smaller}

![The 4 dataset types: tables, networks, fields, geometry](fig/fig2_1b.png)\  

- A **field** contains attribute values associated with cells.
- Each **cell** contains measurements from a *continuous* domain.
  - By contrast, **tables** and **networks** contain *discrete* items.

## Dataset Types {.smaller}

![The 4 dataset types: tables, networks, fields, geometry](fig/fig2_1b.png)\  

- Continuous data require careful treatment of **sampling** to acheive the desired resolution.
  - **Interpolation** can be used to show values in between sampled points in a way that does not mislead.
  - Proper interpolation can be used to **reconstruct** a new view.
  
## Dataset Types {.smaller}

![The 4 dataset types: tables, networks, fields, geometry](fig/fig2_1b.png)\  

- **Spatial fields** are based on sampling at spatial positions.
- Actual spatial positions constrain decisions about spatial arrangement of visualizations.
  - Many spatial arrangement choices for **nonspatial data** are unavailable for **spatial fields**.
  
## Dataset Types {.smaller}

![The 4 dataset types: tables, networks, fields, geometry](fig/fig2_1b.png)\  

- **Geometry** specifies information about the shape of items with explicit spatial positions.
- Like spatial fields, **geometry** datasets are intrinsically spatial.
- Geometry datasets do not necessarily have **attributes**.
  
## Dataset Types {.smaller}

![The 4 dataset types: tables, networks, fields, geometry](fig/fig2_1b.png)\  

- Other combinations of **items** include **sets**, **lists**, and **clusters**.
  - A **set** is an unordered group of items.
  - A **list** is an ordered group of items.
  - A **cluster** is a grouping based on attribute similarity.
  
## Dataset Types {.smaller}

![The 4 dataset types: tables, networks, fields, geometry](fig/fig2_1b.png)\  

- There are also more complex structures built on **networks**.
  - A **path** through a network is an ordered set of **links** connecting **nodes**.
  - A **compound network** is a network with an associated **tree**.
  
## Dataset Availability {.smaller}

- In addition to dataset types, datasets may have different **dataset availability**.
  - In a **static file**, all the data are available at once.
    - Synonym: **offline**
  - In **dynamic streams**, the dataset information trickles (*really?*) in during the course of the session.
    - Synonym: **online**

Attributes may be:

- **Categorical**
- **Ordered**
  - **Ordinal**
  - **Quantitative**

![Attributes may be categorical or ordered; Ordered can be ordinal or quantiative](fig/fig2_1e.png)\
:::

::: {.column width=50%}

- **Categorical** data does not have an implicit ordering, but it often has hierarchical structure.
- For example, favorite fruits.
  - Two items can only be the same (apples) or different (apples vs. oranges).

![Attributes may be categorical or ordered; Ordered can be ordinal or quantiative](fig/fig2_1e.png)\
:::

::: {.column width=50%}

- **Ordered** data does have an implicit ordering.
  - **Ordinal** data does not allow arithmetic, but the order is well-defined.
    - *E.g.*, t-shirt size (S < M < L)
  - **Quantitative** data is a measurement of magnitude that supports arithmetic.

::: {.column width=50%}
![Ordered data may be sequential, diverging, or cyclic](fig/fig2_1f.png)\
:::

::: {.column width=50%}

- **Ordered** data can be sequential, diverging, or cyclic.
  - **Sequential** data have a homogeneous range from minimum to maximum value.
    - *E.g.*, mountain height (above sea level) or bathymetry (below sea level).
  - **Diverging** data can be deconstructed into two sequences pointing in opposite directions (often meeting at 0).
    - *E.g.*, elevation (either above or below sea level).

:::

::: {.column width=50%}

- **Ordered** data can be sequential, diverging, or cyclic.
  - **Cyclic** data have values that wrap around back to the start.
    - *E.g.*, hour of the day/day of the week/week of the year.

# Semantics

## Key vs. Value Semantics

</br>

A **key** attribute acts as an index to lookup **value** attributes

## Key vs. Value Semantics


A **flat table** has only one key. In this case, the `ID` column.

</br>

::: {style="font-size:50%"}
```{r}
#| echo: false

knitr::kable(semantic)
```
:::

## Key vs. Value Semantics


In this case, `Name` might look like an acceptable **key**, but the name `Amy` is not unique.

</br>

::: {style="font-size:50%"}
```{r}
#| echo: false

knitr::kable(semantic)
```
:::

## Key vs. Value Semantics


Sometimes, just the row number is sufficient for as a key. There might not be a column used as a key.

</br>

::: {style="font-size:50%"}
```{r}
#| echo: false

knitr::kable(semantic[, 2:ncol(semantic)])
```
:::

## Key vs. Value Semantics


For a **multidimensional table**, multiple keys are required to identify a unique item.
