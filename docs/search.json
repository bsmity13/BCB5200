Current students please note that we are still using Canvas for submitting assignments and grading.\nThis course material was adapted and developed by Brian J. Smith. The course was originally designed and taught by Barrie Robison, and his version of the material is a valuable resource, available here: https://professorpolymorphic.github.io/BCB520/\nOn this website, you will find an abbreviated syllabus, lectures, code walkthroughs, and assignments."

    "text": "Course Description\nThis class will help students establish a core understanding of data visualization. We will consider how data type (including tabular, network, and spatial data) interacts with visualization task to guide design choices. Diverse types of visual encodings and how they relate to human perception will be presented, along with practical exercises using the R programming language. Upon completion of the course, students will understand WHY particular visualization approaches are effective for a given data set and HOW to implement those visualizations using R. The course is designed to be “discipline agnostic” – each student is encouraged to use data sets that they deem important/interesting. The goal is to have students learn how to develop visualizations that are relevant to their own disciplinary interests."
